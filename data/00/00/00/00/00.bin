  |   You are the pilot of a spacecraft that is looking for and exploring   |
  |   worlds that are potentially suitable for life. While scanning the     |
  |   next target, you lost control of your ship and had to make an         |
  |   emergency landing. It quickly becomes clear that you are not the      |
  |   first person on this planet...                                        |

  |   You have to study the ruins of a long-dead civilization and the       |
  |   abandoned laboratories of researchers who have been on this planet    |
  |   before you. Avoid deadly dangers, study the local flora, fight with   |
  |   hallucinations, and find a way to eliminate the cause of the          |
  |   accident. Do your best to leave this planet and return home!          |
